          <p>This project’s objective was for us students to apply techniques throughout the Stanford d.school design process to create user centered platforms and interfaces, these techniques guided us through the project and allowed us to come up with requirements in order to design an user friendly environment which objective was to fulfill the user’s needs. Before we started designing this platform we needed to determine what was going to be designed and why, so before we started designing, we worked in these. This project conseisted on a BIOS cinema website design. </p>

        <p> This project consisted in a bespoke design for a selected user, during 8 weeks we were given the assignment of getting to know out user through ethnographic research method and with this come up with insights that would allow us to design a final product which was a clickable prototype for a crowfunding website for the Hallmark Companies. We worked in teams of two </p>

              <p>Here you can find my favourite project and the one I consider the finest during my exchange period. This project was also part of the Project bespoke design course and we were also meant to design for a selected user and come up with a gift unwrapping experience. I really liked working on this project and getting to design with Adobe XD and invision was really cool. You can find here some of the iterations mader during the project, some of them product of Hallmark's principal goal: Scalability </p>
