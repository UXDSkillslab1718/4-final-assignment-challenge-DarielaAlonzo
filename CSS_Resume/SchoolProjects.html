        <p>This project’s objective was for us students to apply techniques throughout the Stanford d.school design process to create user centered platforms and interfaces, these techniques will guide us through the project and will allow us to come up with requirements in order to design an user friendly environment which objective is to fulfill the user’s needs. Before we start designing this platform we need to determine what is that is going to be designed and why, so before we start designing, we will be working in the following things for the next week. </p>
